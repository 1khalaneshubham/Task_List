# üõ†Ô∏è Java Full Stack Developer Roadmap

This roadmap provides a structured path to becoming a proficient Java developer, covering Core Java, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and Spring Boot.

---

## üìå 1. Core Java (Beginner to Intermediate)

Learn the fundamentals of Java programming:

### ‚úÖ Basics
- Java Installation & Setup (JDK, JRE, JVM)
- Hello World Program
- Data Types and Variables
- Operators and Expressions
- Conditional Statements (if, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

### ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (Overloading & Overriding)
- Abstraction (Abstract classes & Interfaces)
- Encapsulation

### ‚úÖ Essential Java Concepts
- Arrays & Strings
- Exception Handling (try-catch-finally)
- Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue)
- Wrapper Classes
- Java I/O (File Handling)
- Java Threads & Multithreading Basics

---

## üîå 2. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

JDBC helps Java programs communicate with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

### ‚úÖ JDBC Topics
- JDBC Architecture
- Steps to Connect Java with Database
- DriverManager and Connection
- Statement, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet
- Executing SQL Queries (Insert, Update, Delete, Select)
- Handling Exceptions in JDBC
- Closing Database Resources Properly
- Transactions in JDBC (commit, rollback)

## üöÄ 3. Spring Boot (Backend Framework)

Spring Boot simplifies building production-ready Java web applications.

### ‚úÖ Spring Boot Core Concepts
- Introduction to Spring & Spring Boot
- Setting up Spring Boot Project (Spring Initializr)
- @SpringBootApplication annotation
- REST APIs with Spring Boot
- Annotations: @RestController, @Service, @Repository
- Dependency Injection (Autowired)
- Connecting to MySQL Database
- CRUD operations with Spring Data JPA
- Exception Handling using @ControllerAdvice
- Using Lombok to Reduce Boilerplate
- Running & Testing APIs with Postman
